get away from me you slimy little worm
what a big eater he is
lets go to the mall today
dont be silly youre going to the game
get your act together
dont get too excited
watch out theres quicksand
cry all you want
mind your own business
good gracious
thats right and dont you ever forget it
dont worry about it
sit down and cross your legs please
come on down
hurry up slowpoke
here he comes to save the day
please dont touch that
hand me the hammer
wiggle your fingers
lets never speak of this again
shape up or ship out
dont let it get wet
thats all
go home weirdo
keep it up
look at that pumpkin
what a big house you have
somebody help me
how big you are
no problem
dont worry be happy
ridiculous
dont be nervous
look at the blackboard
keep your hands to yourself
never do that again
what a big dog
how beautiful she is
very good job sweetheart
dont even look at me
god just shut up already
turn around and face the wall
nevermind then
times up
dont open the door
